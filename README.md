# Neural Network Demo
This repository serves as a basic toy neural network written in Rust. The neural network has 1 input node, 1 hidden node and 1 output node, allowing for approximation of a linear function. I plan on creating a larger neural network in the future, but I'm still quite new to neural network programming so don't expect too much ðŸ˜…
